    "# Generative Psuedo Labeling with Claude-3.5-Sonnet & Classification of \"Work Behaviors and Skills\" using AWS Bedrock\n",
    "* Notebook by Adam Lang\n",

    "# Overview\n",
    "* The goal of this notebook is to extract \"Work Behaviors\" and \"Skills\" from a dataset and use Claude-3.5-Sonnet on bedrock to classify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Workflow\n",
    "* We will implement chain-of-thought prompting with Claude-3.5-Sonnet and extract \"behaviors\" and \"skills\" from a pre-processed CSV file that includes a column called \"english_message\" which is translated non-english text to english.\n",
    "* I will then use the LLM to perform Generative Pseudo Labeling where it will generate a label for each behavior and skill so we can build a pseudo classification on the data. "

    "## Step 1 - Extract Behaviors and skills into 2 new columns\n",
    "* We will implement chain-of-thought prompting, and extract specific information from the CSV file. \n",
    "* This is what I will do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Utilize chain of thought prompting .\n",
    "2. I am going to extract phrases from a column in a csv file. The csv file is called `df_triplets_experiment.csv`. There are 3 columns: \"Award Type\", \"english_message\", and \"Department\". The goal is to extract into separate 2 new columns \"work behaviors\" and another column for \"skills\". Think of this as an entity recognition or extraction problem but also I want to be able to classify these results.\n",
    "3. After I extract the 2 new columns for \"work behaviors\" and \"skills\", then in Step 2 I am going to go back and create a general classification of the types of \"work behaviors\" and types of \"skills\". \n",
    "4. The final step would then be to label each of the rows with these in 2 new columns for \"behavior_class\" and \"skill_class\" so that i can link these labels to the \"Award_Type\" and \"Department\" later on for data visualization.\n"
