# MLflow for MLOPs
* MLflow is a vital tool for all phases of the MLOPs project life cycle.

# Data Science Lifecycle
* The processes above are based off the Data Science Lifecycle which every Data Scientist performs when building machine learning models.
* As a reminder these are the typical phases of a Data Science project:
```
1. Data Preparation (e.g. ETL pipelines)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis 
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training
5. Model Validation â€”> ML engineering main role begins here
6. Deployment (e.g. cloud platform)
7. Monitoring
```
* This is where the fusion of Devops with Machine Learning and Data Science comes in to give us MLOPs which we will highlight below. 

# Automated MLOPs Lifecycle
* A typical MLOPs life cycle that is automated looks like this [source](https://pub.towardsai.net/mlops-demystified-6bee7a44ba9a)

# Manual MLOPs Lifecycle
* This is less common but the manual components which are often done by most organizations without automation is as follows:
